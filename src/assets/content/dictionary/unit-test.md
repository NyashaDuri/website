title: unit test
definition: A unit test is a test designed to validate the smallest possible unit of code (e.g. a function or a method) and test it in isolation from the rest of the system. The purpose of unit testing is to validate that each unit of the software works as intended and meets the requirements. Unit tests are usually automated and are run each time the code is changed to ensure that new code does not break existing functionality.
