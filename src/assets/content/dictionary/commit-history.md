title: commit history
definition: 'Allows you to see what has happened in your respository; to review the history. The "git log" command shows the history of commits in a project, in chronological order, starting with the most recent item, including the timestamp and message included with the commit. It lets you go back to any earlier version of a file or whole project, and helps to see and understand how a project has evolved.'
