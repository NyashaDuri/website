title: callback hell
definition: is a term used in programming to describe a situation where multiple nested callback functions in asynchronous code become hard to read, understand, and maintain. This occurs when asynchronous operations are dependent on the results of previous asynchronous operations, leading to deeply nested callback functions, which can make the code difficult to follow and prone to errors.
